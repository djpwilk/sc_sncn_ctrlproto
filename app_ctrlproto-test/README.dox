This application provides example of reading/writing process data to EtherCAT using Ethercat 
handler. Along with how to integrate the firmware update functionality over the EtherCAT.

The application runs 2 threads on the COM_TILE and 1 more thread.

 COM_TILE:

	*Thread: Ethercat Communication Handler
		
		ecat_handler(coe_out, coe_in, eoe_out, eoe_in, eoe_sig, foe_out, foe_in, pdo_out, pdo_in);
		
		We need to run this thread on COM_TILE since this is only tile accessing the ethercat communication module (COM).
	
	*Thread: Firmware update 
	
		firmware_update_loop(p_spi_flash, foe_out, foe_in, sig_1);
		
		We need to run this thread on COM_TILE since it has access to the flash SPI ports.
  
  ANY_TILE (0/1/2/3):
  	
  	*Thread: Test application handling process data objects (pdos) from EtherCAT.

Dependencies: module_ctrlproto sc_sncn_ethercat/module_ethercat sc_somanet-base/module_fwupdate sc_somanet-base/module_nodeconfig

Note: Fore both Core C22 module and Core C21 module, COM_TILE is located on CORE 0.
